# rayze-internal

this is a simple internal cheat for [RAYZE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689190/RAYZE/). I made it for educational purposes only. Im already like top 5th in the world without even cheating, and i dont care what you do with this cheat because its not my responsibility. Have a great day.

features:
- internal
- menu made using imgui
- aimbot (fov based)
- wallhack

note: youll probably have to update offsets and some shit, you can use [il2cpp dumper by perfare](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) to update it by yourself

im giving up, i just dont have the skills to do game cheats anymore. like, what the fuck am i even doing... Even AI couldnt help me, not because its unethical, but because it just straight up gave up after fucking up for straight 20 updates of the project. i should have been doing something else than this fuckass cheat dev
